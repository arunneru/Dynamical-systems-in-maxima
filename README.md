# Dynamical-systems-in-maxima
Exploration in nonlinear dynamics with a computational algebra system (Maxima)

For now, to know what I have done with maxima, you can read through the texts and figures ignoring the scripts at your will. You can play around with the accompanying [wxmaxima](http://wxmaxima-developers.github.io/wxmaxima/) (GUI frontend - Mathematica and Jupyter like notebook for maxima) notebook. You need a working installation of [Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) and wxmaxima for that. As I am planning to explore further the terrains of Maxima, I will upload more explorations. In a while, I will add the comments to the scripts.
